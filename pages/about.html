			<u>Harvest Yields</u> is a free open source piece of software designed to predict future crop yields based on historical weather and harvest data.<br>
			A demo dataset is provided for the Waddington area of Lincolnshire, UK. You may also enter your own historical data and the algorithm will predict a personalised yield.<br><br>
			The software was created by Błażej Berezowski, Harry Clayton, Alex Jeffs, Jamie Land, John McGuire, Ethan Stretton and Tommy Wilson at The University of Lincoln UK as part of<br>
			their Team Software Engineering module.<br><br>
			The software uses libraries such as KNN to take historical weather and crop data from csv files, trains the algorithm, forecasts the weather and then predicts a 
			reasonable assumption for the yield on each of the next 30 days.<br><br>
			Naturally, the running time of the algorithm depends on the size of the data. Also, the accuracy of the prediction drastically increases depeding on the size of the dataset.<br>
			The default dataset provided is 2500 records, however a 400,000 record dataset is also provided. The 2500 will take perhaps 20 minutes to run, the 400,000 will take a number of days 
			(depending on the processing power of your computer).<br><br>
